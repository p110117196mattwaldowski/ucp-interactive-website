                <p>This course includes a wide range of skills identified by both employers and the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) as being important for accountancy and finance graduates in the 21st century.

                    Ethics and sustainable business are covered, as is the ability to communicate effectively both in writing and orally, to work in teams and to be able to think critically and solve problems.
                    
                    The teaching and learning includes a diverse and dynamic range of strategies including practical classes and workshops.
                    
                    Case studies will be used in some modules to both embed knowledge and understanding, but also to allow students to apply their skills in their analysis and problem solving. In some modules, students will have to justify and reflect upon their business decisions and strategies to a panel of academic and industry experts in a ‘Dragon’s Den’ style scenario.
                    
                    Students will be supported to progress through the production of a range of types of outputs that would normally be required in business situations. The development of spreadsheets and use of industry specific software will improve your employability and allow a practical application of knowledge.  This may form a part of a portfolio of the student’s work for assessment purposes. These types of learning experiences have specifically been chosen to emulate the types of experience and skills that are required by industry.
                    
                    Students will be encouraged to be active learners whose knowledge and understanding is gained through the support of academic staff, who will act as mentors, rather than ‘lecturers’. Industry specialists are invited to lectures and again they will not be seen purely as ‘guest lecturers’, but as part of the university community.
                    
                    The courses at University Centre Peterborough are studied in smaller class sizes compared with other universities, a typical class size is under 30 students.</p>
